Application of machine learning / deep learning in finance / investment

<Proposal of short story>

Deep learning is a part of machine learning that learns data representations. Finance is money management. Deep learning in finance is the application of deep learning technologies in the finance field.

The application of machine learning / deep learning in the field of finance / investment is a hot topic in the fields of machine learning, neural networks and deep learning. There have been many relevant studies on how to correctly analyze past financial / investment activities and predict the future price / value of investment targets. The proposal aims to propose a short story about the application of machine learning / deep learning in finance / investment. According to the author of the article "Deep Learning for Financial Applications: A Survey" (source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05786), in the field of machine learning (ML), numerous studies have been published resulting in various models.And deep learning (DL) has recently begun to receive Widely concerned, this is mainly due to its better performance than the classic model.

To supplement the information in this short story, other resources explaining the application of machine learning / deep learning in the financial / investment field will be used. In addition, other sources will be used to compare the application of deep learning (DL) in the financial / investment field to other studies on similar topics. For example, the short story will include another papers in this field,such as  "deep-learning-for-forex-trading" (source: https://medium.com/lusis-ai/deep-learning-for-forex-trading-ba5d466e92cb), to compare with other existing studies.

The short story's structure and format will begin with the introduction of financial / invested programmatic trading and Decision Support Systems, then briefly introduce existing research on programmatic trading /Decision Support Systems and machine learning / Deep Learning that have been published for several years, and then introduce the  emerging technologies for investment in programmatic trading/Decision Support Systems. While discussing financial / investment programmatic trading and Decision Support Systems, this short story will also explain the proposed models that the source papers have used for their research.
